## 📖 Overview

Nexus Bank is a comprehensive digital banking solution. Built with a robust **Java Spring Boot backend** and a beautiful **React frontend**, it provides a complete banking lifecycle. Users can experience self-service registration, real-time ledger tracking, instant transfers, and an administrative oversight portal.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Smart Global Ledger:** The system automatically tracks counterparty logic (`To: Account` vs `From: Account`) across a system-wide unified ledger.

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Architecture

This project is fully "Cloud-Ready" and is actively deployed using modern PaaS providers.

### 1. Database (Aiven MySQL)
- MySQL database hosted on [Aiven.io](https://aiven.io/).
- Provides a secure, scalable data layer with enforced SSL.

### 2. Backend (Render.com)
- Spring Boot REST API deployed as a Web Service on [Render](https://render.com).
- Uses Environment Variables for database injection:
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` (JDBC URL with SSL enabled)
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`

### 3. Frontend (Vercel)
- React SPA deployed globally via [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- Routes all API calls to the Render backend using the Environment Variable:
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Utilizes `vercel.json` to handle client-side routing fallbacks gracefully.
